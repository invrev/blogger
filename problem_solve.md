@ Abstract level identify 3 levels
    1.Data structure
        1.Arrays and Strings
        2.Linked list (SLL,DLL)
            
        3.Trees (Binary trees,BST,Augmented BST
        ,Self balanced trees(AVL,Red-black,2-4,2-3-4 tree,Splay tree))
        Self balanced trees
        (height of right subtree @T) = (height of left subtree @T)
        Same reasoning that quick sort needs the balnaced parition.
        RBT :
            keep the all the leaves at same depth(asymptotic).
        AVL :
            maintain (height of left subtree) = (height of right subtree)
        Splay tree:
            Does not require the additional data fields unlike RBL(color),AVL(height)

        4.Heaps
        5.Hash Table
        6.Stack and queues
        7.

        
        
    2.Algorithm paradigms
        1.Sorting algorithm (Comparison sort,Counting sort)
        2.
        
    3.Analysis pattern


To solve problems
    1. Understand 
    2. Realization
    3. Clean algorithm
    4. Implementation
