Analyze the problems before solving the problem,If possible 
try to identify the hidden motivation gained by solving the problem.

BST :
DS to store the (key,value) pair
* (username, password)
* MapReduce framework
* Domain Name System
* Database indexing
* Dictionary lookup
* Kademlia DHT
* Associative arrays (remember “string”->func*)

Successor,Predecessor

Trees more commonaly used are the binary tree.
Expression tree,Huffman tree,Decision tree,Heap data structure

Encoding and decoding the string
All characters are not born equal.
However each character occupies the 1 byte (8 bit) when it comes to storage.
*Encoding
    Encode the string
    for e.g. 
             b(e) : # of bits req. to encode the character b
             b(j) : # of bits req. to encode the character j
             f : frquencey vector 
    b(e)*f(e) + b(j)*f(j) < 8*f(e) + 8*f(j)
*Decoding
    Decode the string
    Use prefix-free code
*Any tree can be encoded as the binary tree.


Leaves,internal node,root,Ancenstor,Descendants

*Ancenstor




1. Width of tree
2. Span of tree
3. Tree diameter(LAN packet transfer worst case scenario)
4. Tree Traversal (with stack(with recursive),queue (level order) ,zig-zag order traversal)
5. Depth/Height of the tree (Maximum height of the tree is the depth of binary tree.)
6. Full vs perfect binary tree (Total # of nodes in the full binary tree = 2^(h+1))
7. Governing catalan # 
8. Use of trees in the database (for efficient storage of the data)
Use of heap like data stucture
9. BST (Binary search tree)
10. Other types of trees (act of balancing)
11. Reconstruction of binary trees (Given inorder + (preorder/postorder) traversal construct the binary tree.)
12. Concept of horizontal distance (Compute the vertical sum of binary tree)
13. # of trees with given inorder sequence (Catalan #)
